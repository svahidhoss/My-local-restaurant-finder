Local Restaurant Finder
Project Description: The application will serve as a platform for users to discover local restaurants based on their current location. It will provide details about the restaurants such as name, description, ratings, and reviews.

Features and Functionalities:
User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality. This can be done using Firebase Authentication or any other suitable method.
Restaurant Listing: Display a list of restaurants based on the user's current location. This data should be fetched from a web service using Retrofit or any other suitable method.
Restaurant Details: When a user selects a restaurant from the list, display detailed information about the restaurant. This can include name, description, ratings, reviews, and images.
Favorites: Allow users to mark restaurants as favorites. These favorites should be stored in a local database using Room or SQLite.
Offline Support: The app should work offline and display the favorite restaurants even when there is no internet connection.
Configuration Changes: The app should handle configuration changes like screen rotation, language change, etc., without losing any data or state.

Technical Requirements:
Local Database: Use Room or SQLite for local data storage.
Web Services: Use Retrofit or a similar library for network calls.
User Authentication: Use Firebase Authentication or a similar service.
MVVM Architecture: Use Model-View-ViewModel architecture for structuring the app.
Data Binding: Use Data Binding or View Binding to bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
Dependency Injection: Use Dagger2 or Hilt for dependency injection.
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for the business logic.
UI Testing: Write UI tests using Espresso.

This project will be less challenging than the previous one but will still test the Android Engineers' knowledge and skills in key areas of Android development.
